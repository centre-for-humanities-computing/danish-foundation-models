A collaborative project for training foundational Danish language model. Which seeks to:

- Develop and maintain **state-of-the-art models** for Danish, 
- which are **well-validated** across a wide range of tasks.
- Furthermore, we wish to **ensure good documentation**, which allows users to assess the model for their use-case critically
- **Open-source**, both model and source code

*Note*: This repository is intended for the text model of DFM.

You can contribute both:

-  Developer time, the lifeblood of any open-source project
-  Pre-training datasets you wish to include in the model training
-  Validation tasks can even be private benchmarks where you only wish to share the performance metrics.
- And probably in many other ways

## Setting up development environment
### Method 1: Dev container
By far the easiest way is to use our included development container. If you're using VSCode:

* Ensure you have either [Orbstack](https://orbstack.dev) or [Docker](https://docker.com) installed 
* Press this button: [![Open in Dev Container](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Dev%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/centre-for-humanities-computing/danish-foundation-models/)
* Select "From Dockerfile"
* Press "OK" on the feature screen

### Method 2: Manual install
Install as you usually would, replicating the commands in the `Dockerfile.dev`.
