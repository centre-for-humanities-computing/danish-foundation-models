A collaborative project for training foundational Danish language model. Which seeks to:

- Develop and maintain **state-of-the-art models** for Danish, 
- which are **well-validated** across a wide range of tasks.
- Furthermore, we wish to **ensure good documentation**, which allows users to assess the model for their use-case critically
- **Open-source**, both model and source code

*Note*: This repository is intended for the text model of DFM.

You can contribute both:

-  Developer time, the lifeblood of any open-source project
-  Pre-training datasets you wish to include in the model training
-  Validation tasks can even be private benchmarks where you only wish to share the performance metrics.
- And probably in many other ways
