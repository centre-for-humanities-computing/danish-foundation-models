# Adding a new dataset

This guide is intended for internal collaborators. If you want to add a new dataset to the DFM, but are not a collaborator, please open an issue in this repository or contact us at using the contact form on the [website](https://www.foundationmodels.dk/#join-us).

1) Add a datasheet to the `docs/datasheets` folder, e.g. [`nordjylland_news.md`](https://github.com/centre-for-humanities-computing/danish-foundation-models/blob/main/docs/datasheets/nordjylland_news.md). The datasheet should be named `<dataset_name>.md`. The datasheet should be written in markdown format and should have a front matter following the [Huggingface dataset card template](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/en/upload_dataset#create-a-dataset-card). It should have the following attributes:
   1) a license (if the license is not a standard once allowed by Huggingface, please use "other" and specify the license in the datasheet)
   2) Languages (e.g. "da" for Danish)
2) Add a dataset of the same name to the `/danish-foundation-models (193701)/dfm-data/pre-training/` on UCloud. Using the following folder structure:
```
pre-training
│
└── dataset_name
    │
    ├── documents
    │   └── dataset_name.jsonl.gz
    │
    └── attributes   # OPTIONAL: folder containing annotations from dataset cleaning
```

## JSONL Schema

An entry in the dataset should adhere to the Document schema (defined below).

```
{
    "id": "...",                      # MANDATORY: source-specific identifier
    "text": "foo",                    # MANDATORY: textual content of the document
    "source": "...",                  # MANDATORY: source of the data, such as peS2o, common-crawl, etc.
    "added": "...",                   # MANDATORY: timestamp we acquired this data (time file was created), specified as
                                        # YYYY-MM-DD e.g 2021-04-13
    "created": "..."                  # MANDATORY: timestamp when orig document was created (best-guess if not available),
                                         # should be specified as a range;
                                         # "YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM-DD"
    "metadata": {                     # OPTIONAL: source-specific metadata
         ...
     }
}
