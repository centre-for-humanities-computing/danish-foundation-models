# Empowering the Danish Language in the Digital Age

Welcome to the Danish Foundation Models (DFM) project, a pioneering initiative in the field of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) dedicated to the Danish language. Our mission is to develop, maintain, and provide open access to high-quality foundation models tailored for Danish, promoting innovation and inclusivity in language technologies.

## Why Danish Foundation Models?

### Bridging the Digital Language Divide

- **Global Gap**: The rise of large language models has transformed research and technology, but smaller languages like Danish risk falling behind both in development, evaluation and application.
- **Local Focus**: We combat this by focusing on the Danish language, ensuring that it is well-represented in the digital landscape.
- **Broad Collaboration**: Our project unites public and private institutions, ensuring high data quality and practical applicability of our models.

## Our Objectives  

1. To develop and maintain **state-of-the-art language models for Danish** for applications within both text and speech.
2. To extensively **validate** foundation models for Danish in a representative set of tasks.
3. To maintain a high standard of **documentation** of models such as model cards \[[Mitchell et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993)\] and datasheets \[[Gebru et al., 2021](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2021/12/256932-datasheets-for-datasets/abstract)\].
4. To **open-source** not only the models but also all components required for reproducibility such as pre-processing, training, and validation code.




##  Open-source models on closed-source data

As many of the datasets we use either contain personally sensitive information or fall under copyright they can't be shared publicly. However, we want to share as
much as possible from the project, while protecting privacy and adhering to copyright law. 
Thus we organize it such that all parts of the project that can be shared and those which
can't are well-documented using datasheets and training logs. 
Furthermore, during data processing and training, the data is stored on UCloud which follows the highest standards of information security management with a [formal ISO27001 certification](https://docs.cloud.sdu.dk/intro/security.html).

## Improving the Danish Language Technology Landscape

The Danish Foundations models collaborate with the [Danish Data Science Community](https://danskdatascience.dk/), [Centre for Humanities Computing Aarhus](https://chcaa.io/), [The Alexandra Institute](https://alexandra.dk) to promote the development of Danish language tools. We continually gather information about how to improve the Danish language technologies and how to best support the community. To this end we have created a [list of missing pieces for Danish NLP](https://github.com/centre-for-humanities-computing/danish-foundation-models/discussions/categories/missing-pieces-for-danish-nlp) and we invite any 1) to add to the list, 2) solve one of the problems or 3) upvote the problems you think are most important.
