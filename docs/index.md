# Empowering the Danish Language in the Digital Age

Welcome to the Danish Foundation Models (DFM) project, a pioneering initiative in the field of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) dedicated to the Danish language. Our mission is to develop, maintain, and provide open access to high-quality foundation models tailored for Danish, promoting innovation and inclusivity in language technologies.

## Why Danish Foundation Models?

### Bridging the Digital Language Divide

- **Global Gap**: The rise of large language models has transformed research and technology, but smaller languages like Danish risk falling behind both in development, evaluation and application.
- **Local Focus**: We combat this by focusing on the Danish language, ensuring that it is well-represented in the digital landscape.
- **Broad Collaboration**: Our project unites public and private institutions, ensuring high data quality and practical applicability of our models.

## Our Objectives

1. To develop and maintain **state-of-the-art language models for Danish** for applications within both text and speech.
2. To extensively **validate** foundation models for Danish in a representative set of tasks.
3. To maintain a high standard of **documentation** of models such as model cards \[[Mitchell et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993)\] and datasheets \[[Gebru et al., 2021](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2021/12/256932-datasheets-for-datasets/abstract)\].
4. To **open-source** not only the models but also all components required for reproducibility such as pre-processing, training, and validation code.




##  Open-source Development with Privacy-Focused Data Handling

In our commitment to advancing open-source development, we strongly emphasise the ethical handling of data, particularly when it involves personally sensitive information or material under copyright. This ensures that we share as much as possible while protecting privacy and adhering to copyright laws.

To achieve this, our project is structured to differentiate between data that can be shared openly and that which cannot. This demarcation is documented through detailed datasheets and training logs, hereby ensuring transparency and accountability in our processes.

Additionally, we prioritize the security of the data during its processing and training phases. All data is stored on UCloud, a platform that upholds the highest standards in information security management. This commitment to data security is exemplified by UCloud's adherence to ISO27001, a globally recognized standard, ensuring that our data handling practices meet rigorous international criteria. For more information on our security measures, please visit UCloud's security [documentation](https://docs.cloud.sdu.dk/intro/security.html).

## Improving the Danish Language Technology Landscape

The Danish Foundations models collaborate with the [Danish Data Science Community](https://danskdatascience.dk/), [Centre for Humanities Computing Aarhus](https://chcaa.io/), [The Alexandra Institute](https://alexandra.dk), and [Center for AI Science and Applications](https://sdu.dk/casa) to promote the development of Danish language tools. We continually gather information about how to improve the Danish language technologies and how to best support the community. To this end we have created a [list of missing pieces for Danish NLP](https://github.com/centre-for-humanities-computing/danish-foundation-models/discussions/categories/missing-pieces-for-danish-nlp) and we invite any 1) to add to the list, 2) solve one of the problems or 3) upvote the problems you think are most important.
